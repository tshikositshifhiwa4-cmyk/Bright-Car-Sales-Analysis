# Project Overview

This project analyses the Bright Car Sales dataset to understand sales performance, revenue drivers, profitability, and vehicle characteristics.
Using SQL (Snowflake/BigQuery) and Excel visualisations, the project cleans the dataset, performs calculations, and produces insights on model performance, transmission trends, and profit margins.
The goal is to demonstrate practical data analytics skills through a full end-to-end analysis workflow.

# Objectives

Clean and prepare car sales data for analysis 

Convert text-based prices into numeric values

Calculate units sold, total revenue, and estimated profit margins

Analyse sales distribution by make, model, year, body type, and transmission

Categorise car models into performance tiers (High, Medium, Low, Negative Margin)

Visualise key sales and profitability trends

Summarise findings into clear, decision-ready insights

# Methodology (Summary)

Imported dataset into SQL environment and checked structure

Cleaned selling prices (removed commas, converted to numeric)

Standardised categorical fields (make, model, body, transmission)

Calculated total revenue, units sold, and profit margins using MMR as cost

Grouped and aggregated data by model, make, year, and state

Created performance tiers based on profit margin percentage

Built visualisations showing revenue by model, transmission, year, and margin category

Interpreted patterns to identify best and worst performing segments

# Key Insights

Revenue is dominated by a few major makes and models, while most models contribute minimally

Automatic cars generate 85% of total revenue, showing strong customer preference

Low-margin and negative-margin cars make up most of the revenue, indicating limited profitability

Revenue peaks sharply between 2010–2014 before declining

Sales are geographically concentrated, with a few states contributing most of the revenue

# Technologies Used

SQL (Snowflake)

Excel (charts, pivot tables)

Python (optional for data inspection)

Canva / PowerPoint (visual presentation)
